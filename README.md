Key take aways: 
Return is like return to where you started from. It reminds me of hitting the "Enter" key. 
I just hit the enter the ket and it brought me back to the side of the page from where I started. 

I think of return like the boomerang in Zelda. It returns whatever you throw it at. A coin. A heart, etc. 

I guess that's a fetch request on a smaller scale. 

First off, import random

then create variable for all of the spaces. 
Variables for possible choices
a variable for players points
a variable for computers points

A function for interaction with the player

A function for generating a random response from the computer

A game function where the player represents the "players choice"
the computer represents the "computer's choice"

Then a comparison of winning conditons in which either the computer or the player are evaluated as the winner.
